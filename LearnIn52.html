        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>We here at LearnIn5 want to, first and foremost, help our users get more information on diverse topics in a short amount of time. How do we plan on doing this? Through fast to go through quizzes that focus on specific subjects and despite not making you an expert on them, definitely provide you with some new and important information that will benefit you on your daily life.</p>

        <h1>What have we done?</h1>
        <p>Nothing REAL yet. But not to worry because our first prototype is already available for everyone to experience, and we are counting on our users to help us improve before we launch. Our first venture is called Haircare Edition and I think you can tell by the name what it focuses on. If you are someone with interest in this area, be sure to check us out and give your feedback, it is the only way we can make sure the final product will be something you'll like!</p>

        <h1>5 minutes is enough</h1>
        <p>Taking the risk of sounding corny, we care about YOU. We genuinenly do. We want to help you be the best version you can be and we know your time is precious, that's why we want to steal as little of it as possible while giving you the most return that we can. We don't promise to make you an expert in Haircare, for instance, but we do feel like the 5 minutes we ask of you will make you aware of little changes you can make to be healthier.</p>

        <h1>A brief introduction</h1>
        <p>Our main goal in building this prototype was to get a very simple looking design that would be very easy to work with and fast to get through so no time feels wasted. We didn't want you to be lost or stuck at any point.</p>

      <div class="col-3">
        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p>There are 5 Yes or No questions that will give you feedback adequate to your answer. We wanted people who are doing something wrong to know why and how to fix it but we also wanted to give the people who are already on the right track an extra bit of information that would help them improve.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-3">
        <h1>What's in it for you</h1>
        <p>For the moment there is no prize, except for self-improvement. When you finish the quiz you will be ranked based on your answers against other users on your same age range and also on the same location to give you a feel of the community and your place in it, but feel free to suggest other rewards that you would like to get and if possible, we will implement them in the future! As we keep on saying, we care about you and we want you to feel appreciated and that participating feels good for you!</p>
